# CS50x
 This repo contains my attempts at solving the Labs and Problem sets from Harvards CS50X course. Technology used throughout the course include C, python, SQL and the flask framework.

 This course is one of the first courses i took as an amateur programmer and it really exposed me to a lot of concepts about programming in general. The course was rigorous but it prepared me for what's ahead. I am still learning and i had a lot of help while attempting the assignments, most of the help and reference code snippets are duly acknowledged within the files.

 This repository is open to the public and is free for whoever wants to use it as a guide, just as long as CS50's academic honesty policy is adhered to.
